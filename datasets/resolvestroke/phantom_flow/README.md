# OpenH-RF - Resolve Stroke Flow Phantom (CIRS 769 + ATS523A) On/Off

## Dataset Description

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) acquisition of a flow phantom (CIRS 769 + ATS523A)
with microbubble contrast agent. Acquired with SYLVER, Resolve Stroke's ultrasound
device, using a 32×32 matrix probe with diverging-wave transmits at 4 kHz frame
rate. The acquisition captures a flow-on/flow-off bolus wash-in scenario: microbubbles
are injected, flow through the phantom pipe, and gradually wash out.

Five 1-second clips (4000 frames each, 20000 total) are extracted at intervals
relative to the end-of-baseline marker:

| Clip | Time offset | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `baseline_minus1s` | baseline − 1 s | Before microbubble arrival |
| `baseline_plus5s` | baseline + 5 s | Early wash-in |
| `baseline_plus10s` | baseline + 10 s | Mid wash-in |
| `baseline_plus15s` | baseline + 15 s | Late wash-in |
| `baseline_plus20s` | baseline + 20 s | Plateau / early wash-out |

## Intended Usage

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound flow quantification, microbubble detection and
tracking, power-Doppler and CEUS flow imaging, and matrix-probe diverging-wave
beamforming research (RFP task group 6.2, Blood Flow).

## Dataset Characterization

- Data collection method: Phantom (CIRS 769 + ATS523A flow phantom with microbubble contrast agent)
- Labeling method: Automatic, no manual annotation. The per-voxel tube mask comes from
  the known phantom geometry; the reference maps (`mvi`, radial velocities) are generated
  by SYLVER's processing pipeline from the complete bolus passage (see
  [Computed References](#computed-references)). Per-frame clip labels
  (`metadata/annotations/label`, one of the five clip names above) are assigned from
  the acquisition time relative to the end-of-baseline marker.
- Acquisition system: SYLVER (Resolve Stroke's ultrasound device). 32×32 matrix
  probe, 0.50 mm pitch, 0.30 mm kerf; transmit center frequency ≈ 2.031 MHz, sound
  speed 1540 m/s. Diverging-wave transmits; receive sub-apertures flattened into 256
  virtual elements. Channel data is DDC (baseband) IQ, so `sampling_frequency`
  (≈ 2.031 MHz) is the post-decimation IQ rate and equals `demodulation_frequency`.

## Dataset Format

Single zea HDF5 file (`phantom_flow.hdf5`) containing all 5 clips concatenated.
Gaps between clips are encoded in `scan/time_to_next_transmit`. Per-frame clip
labels are stored in `metadata/annotations/label`.

Computed reference maps (derived from the SYLVER processed exam) are stored in the
zea `custom` group under `custom/computed_references/`: `mvi`,
`velocity_radial_avg` / `_min` / `_max`, `tube_mask`, and a shared `coordinates`
array (per-voxel `[x, y, z]` in metres), all on one 0.6 mm Cartesian grid
`(192, 171, 171)`. Read them via `zea.File(...).custom`. They live in `custom`
rather than a second track because zea uses a single global `n_frames`: a
single-frame reference map cannot share that dimension with the per-frame
`metadata/annotations/label` (20000), so a reference track fails spec validation.

The file is in the zea HDF5 format, root `zea_version` 0.1.6, validated `compliant: true` against `validate_zea_spec.py`.
`data/raw_data` is DDC IQ (last axis [I, Q]). The hardware
time-gain compensation is baked into `raw_data`; `scan/tgc_gain_curve` is the applied
(non-linear) gain per axial sample; divide by it to recover true channel amplitudes.
The reconstruction scripts divide `raw_data` by this curve before beamforming (the
`zea.Pipeline` itself stays standard; the reversal is a plain array step).

## Subject Metadata

- Type: Phantom (CIRS 769 + ATS523A flow phantom)
- Contrast agent: Microbubbles (bolus injection)
- Flow: On/off during acquisition

## Data Validation

`reconstruct.py` first divides `raw_data` by `scan/tgc_gain_curve` (reverse TGC),
then runs a standard `zea.Pipeline` (cast → DAS beamform → envelope → normalize →
log-compress) defined in `pipeline.yaml` to reconstruct a B-mode from the IQ channel
data. Because the probe is a 2D matrix array insonified by a single diverging-wave
transmit, `reconstruct.py` beamforms on polar (sector) grids and renders two
perpendicular sector B-modes, the x-z plane (y = 0) and the y-z plane (x = 0), side
by side:

Run: `uv run --project /path/to/OpenH-RF python reconstruct.py`

### Power-Doppler reconstruction (derived product)

`reconstruct_PD_3d.py` (config `pipeline_PD_3d.yaml`) demonstrates a flow/contrast
view. For each clip it beamforms all 4000 frames, in blocks of 250, onto a real 3D
polar sector volume (radius × azimuth × elevation), applies a 100 Hz slow-time
high-pass (wall) filter to suppress stationary tissue, and integrates power Doppler
(sum of the squared envelope over the frames), then displays x-z and y-z
maximum-intensity projections (MIPs) for all five clips in dB relative to the maximum
over the clips (-25 to -5 dB, gamma 1.25, `hot` colormap), with the reference `mvi`
map of the same file in the last column for comparison. The wall filter and
power-Doppler integration are custom `zea` pipeline ops registered in the script
(`tissue_highpass`, `power_doppler`). The hardware TGC stored in `raw_data` is kept.

Run (a GPU is strongly recommended: about 14 min per acquisition with `uv sync --extra gpu`,
hours with the CPU-only JAX of the plain `uv sync`):

```bash
uv run --project /path/to/OpenH-RF python reconstruct_PD_3d.py
```

## Computed References

Reference maps derived from the SYLVER processed exam of this acquisition, stored
in `custom/computed_references/` (read via
`zea.File(...).dataset("custom/computed_references/<name>")`). All share one
0.6 mm Cartesian grid `(192, 171, 171)`; the `coordinates` array gives each voxel's
`[x, y, z]` in metres.

The reference maps were computed by SYLVER's proprietary processing pipeline from
the complete bolus passage, not from the five 1 s clips released here. They are
therefore not reproducible from the released frames, and are provided as reference
targets, for instance for learning-based reconstruction, microbubble-flow or perfusion
estimation from the channel data. They are a device output, not a clinically validated
ground truth. `tube_mask` is the known phantom geometry and is an actual ground truth.

| Field | dtype | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mvi` | float32 | a.u. | Microvascular image. NaN outside the sonified cone. |
| `velocity_radial_avg` | float32 | m/s | Mean radial (along-beam) flow velocity; NaN where no flow. |
| `velocity_radial_min` | float32 | m/s | Minimum radial flow velocity; NaN where no flow. |
| `velocity_radial_max` | float32 | m/s | Maximum radial flow velocity; NaN where no flow. |
| `tube_mask` | uint8 | n/a | Tube ground truth: 1 = tube (⌀4 mm), 2 = tube (⌀2 mm), 0 = background. |
| `coordinates` | float32 | m | Per-voxel `[x, y, z]` for all maps. |

Notes:
- Velocities are radial (Doppler, along-beam). The probe sits at ~72° to the flow,
  so true speed ≈ radial ÷ cos(72°).
- Tube ground truth: two straight parallel tubes fitted to the flow, ⌀4 mm and
  ⌀2 mm, ~35 mm apart, direction ≈ (−0.95, +0.04, +0.31), spanning the imaging cone.

`display_references.py` renders all reference maps to a montage. It reads
`custom/computed_references/` (via `h5py`; no beamforming) and, for each map, shows
two orthogonal maximum-intensity projections (x-z on top, y-z below) on the true
Cartesian geometry: `mvi` in magma, the velocities in a symmetric blue-white-red
map (±0.76 m/s), and `tube_mask` as discrete labels (⌀4 mm, ⌀2 mm):

Run: `uv run --project /path/to/OpenH-RF python display_references.py`

## Known Issues

- `raw_data` has the hardware TGC baked in; `scan/tgc_gain_curve` is that (non-linear)
  applied curve. The reconstruction scripts divide by the curve before beamforming;
  a downstream user reconstructing directly must divide by the curve too.
- `sampling_frequency ≈ center_frequency` because the data is DDC baseband IQ (see
  Dataset Characterization), not an RF acquisition.

## Ethical Considerations

Phantom data: no human subjects, no ethical concerns.
