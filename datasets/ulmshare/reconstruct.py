"""Example reconstruction script for the ulmshare dataset of OpenH-RF.

Dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenH-RF/tree/main/ulmshare

B-mode, power-Doppler and ULM reconstruction of transcranial plane-wave IQ
channel data.

Alongside the B-mode, a tissue-suppression pass gives the clutter-filtered IQ
movie behind the power-Doppler output and the ULM density map (see :mod:`ulm`).
Everything is written into OUT_DIR: ``bmode.png``, ``power_doppler.png``,
``power_doppler_movie.gif`` and ``ulm_density.png``.

Only a fraction of the acquisition is used. By default the Power-Doppler and
ULM outputs are built from the first ``N_FRAMES`` = 4 buffers (1600 frames) of
an acquisition of ~76000 frames (~178 GB), streamed from the Hub. That's enough
to check that the pipeline works, but the ULM density map will be much sparser
than the one in the ULMShare paper. To reproduce the paper, set
``N_FRAMES = None`` to use all frames, streamed or from a local copy (point
``ZEA_FILE`` at it).

The frames are processed one 400-frame acquisition buffer at a time -- stream,
beamform, SVD clutter filter, localize, track -- so memory stays flat however
many frames are used, and the next buffer is read while the current one is
processed. Each stage's output is checkpointed per buffer under zea's cache
directory (``CHECKPOINT_DIR``), so an interrupted run resumes, and re-running
with, e.g., other ULM parameters recomputes only the stages they affect.

Requires zea>=0.1.6 (https://github.com/tue-bmd/zea), the library that does the
ultrasound processing here, together with one of its Keras backends (JAX,
PyTorch or TensorFlow). Installation instructions are at
https://zea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.
