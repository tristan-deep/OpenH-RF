# OpenH-RF Sub-Dataset: 2D Ring-Array USCT Waveforms from 2D- and 3D-k-Wave Simulations

## Dataset Description

This sub-dataset provides **pre-beamformed channel-domain radio-frequency
ultrasound waveforms** from simulated ring-array **ultrasound computed
tomography (USCT)** acquisitions of digital breast phantoms. All data are
two-dimensional: each acquisition is a 2D channel tensor (transmit × time ×
receiver) recorded at a 256-element ring as every element fires in turn, paired
with 2D voxel-level ground-truth maps of **speed-of-sound (SOS)** and **acoustic
attenuation** for a single breast cross-section.

What distinguishes the two collections is **the k-Wave simulation used to
generate the RF**:

- **2D-sim** (2,149 acquisitions): RF computed with **2D** k-Wave
  (`kspaceFirstOrder2D`) on the breast cross-section.
- **3D-sim** (476 acquisitions): RF computed with **3D** k-Wave
  (`kspaceFirstOrder3D`) on the full breast volume, then recorded at the ring
  plane. The 3D simulation captures out-of-plane propagation and finite
  focused-element behaviour that a 2D simulation cannot represent.

Both collections are generated from the **same underlying digital breast
phantoms** (derived from the open VICTRE breast model), enabling direct study of
how 3D acoustic effects change the channel data relative to an idealized 2D
simulation. All data are **synthetic (simulated)**; no human or animal subjects
are involved.

## License / Terms of Use

**CC BY 4.0.** All contributed data are cleared for this license. The data are
fully synthetic (no patient data, no consent or IRB requirements). The digital
breast phantoms derive from the publicly available VICTRE model (U.S. FDA / NCI,
public domain).

## Intended Usage

- **Sound-speed estimation / imaging** (quantitative SOS reconstruction).
- **Acoustic-attenuation imaging.**
- **Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT)** reconstruction from full-ring
  channel data.
- **Compressed sensing** — sub-sampling along the transmit
  (Tx) or receive (Rx) axis and recovering missing channels.

## Dataset Characterization

- **Data Collection Method:** synthetic (k-Wave simulation).
- **Labeling Method:** synthetic ground truth (voxel-level SOS and attenuation
  maps are the exact simulation inputs; no annotation error).
- **Acquisition system** (the label denotes the k-Wave simulation dimensionality;
  the recorded data are 2D in both cases):

## Dataset Format

All data are packaged in the **`zea` HDF5 file format** (one `.hdf5` file per
acquisition), written entirely through `zea.File.create`. Each file stores the
raw channel data under `tracks/track_0/data/raw_data`, the acquisition parameters
under `tracks/track_0/scan`, the ring geometry under `probe` (in the **XZ imaging
plane**, y = elevation), and the voxel-level ground truth as native zea map fields
`tracks/track_0/data/sos_map` and `tracks/track_0/data/attenuation_map` (each with
per-pixel `coordinates`). Tissue class is stored in `metadata/annotations`
(`anatomy`, `label`); only fields with no standard spec home (z-plane indices,
element focus) are zea `CustomElement`s under the top-level `custom/` group. Files
are laid out by simulation type: `data/2d/` (2D-sim) and `data/3d/` (3D-sim),
produced by
[`convert_2d_to_zea.py`](convert_2d_to_zea.py) and
[`convert_3d_to_zea.py`](convert_3d_to_zea.py) respectively.

**Pre-processing applied before packaging:**
- 2D-sim: temporal decimation by 3× (20 MHz → 6.67 MHz native simulation rate).
  3D-sim: saved at the native 12 MHz, no decimation.
- Time-zero is carried in `scan/initial_times`; the per-sample time vector is
  `initial_times[tx] + n / sampling_frequency`. In **both** sets `t = 0` is the
  emission centroid: `initial_times = -2.15e-6` (2D-sim) and `-1.625e-6` (3D-sim,
  the 5-cycle toneburst centroid). The 3D simulation saved its time vector from
  the pulse onset, so this centroid offset is applied during conversion.
- Single-element transmit events are described by `scan/tx_apodizations` with zero
  `scan/t0_delays`. **2D-sim:** all 256 elements fire (identity matrix).
  **3D-sim:** 64 events fire every 4th element (a `(64, 256)` stride-4 matrix).
- Per-acquisition channel data stored as `float32` (zea's `raw_data` spec allows
  only `float32` or `int16`). The 2D-sim RF was decimated and intermediately
  cached at fp16 precision, so its stored `float32` is bit-faithful to that source
  rather than carrying extra precision; the 3D-sim RF is the native `float32`
  simulation output.
- No demodulation or beamforming is applied — data are raw RF channel signals.

## Dataset Quantification

- **Number of acquisitions:** **2,149 (2D-sim)** (1,859 dense + 290 fatty) +
  **476 (3D-sim)** = **2,625 acquisitions**.
- **Single-Tx channel-capture frames:** 2,149 × 256 (2D-sim) + 476 × 64 (3D-sim)
  ≈ **5.8 × 10⁵ frames**.
- **Train / val / test split:** suggested 80 / 10 / 10 by **source phantom**
  (so slices/z-planes from one phantom never cross splits — prevents leakage).
- **Total size on disk:** ~395 GB float32 — ~333 GB (2D-sim, ~160 MB/acq) +
  ~62 GB (3D-sim, ~140 MB/acq).

**Per-sample feature table — 2D-sim** (HDF5 keys per `.hdf5` acquisition):

| Key | Shape | Dtype | Units | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tracks/track_0/data/raw_data` | `(1, 256, 867, 256, 1)` | float32 | a.u. (pressure) | Raw channel data, axis order `(n_frames, n_tx, n_ax, n_el, n_ch)` |
| `tracks/track_0/scan/sampling_frequency` | scalar | float32 | Hz | 6.67e6 |
| `tracks/track_0/scan/center_frequency` | scalar | float32 | Hz | 1.0e6 |
| `tracks/track_0/scan/sound_speed` | scalar | float32 | m/s | Reference (water) sound speed, 1500 |

| `tracks/track_0/scan/tx_apodizations` | `(256, 256)` | float32 | – | Identity: transmit event *i* fires element *i* |
| `tracks/track_0/scan/t0_delays` | `(256, 256)` | float32 | s | Transmit delays (zeros — single-element transmits) |
| `tracks/track_0/scan/transmit_origins` | `(256, 3)` | float32 | m | Firing-element position per Tx |
| `probe/probe_geometry` | `(256, 3)` | float32 | m | Ring element coordinates `(x, y=0, z)` in the XZ plane, 60 mm radius |
| `tracks/track_0/data/sos_map/values` | `(1, 230, 230)` | float32 | m/s | Ground-truth SOS map |
| `tracks/track_0/data/sos_map/coordinates` | `(230, 230, 3)` | float32 | m | Per-pixel `[x, y=0, z]` (dx = 0.30 mm, centred on ring; x=cols, z=rows) |

| `metadata/annotations` | – | str | – | `anatomy="breast"`, `label="dense"`/`"fatty"` |
| `custom/z_slice` | scalar | int | – | Phantom z-slice index |

Attenuation is stored in the zea base unit **dB/m/Hz** (`1 dB/cm/MHz = 1e-4
dB/m/Hz`); the `sos_map`/`attenuation_map` `coordinates` carry the physical grid
(so `dx` is implicit), and `scan/sound_speed` holds the water reference.

**Per-sample feature table — 3D-sim** (HDF5 keys per `.hdf5` acquisition):

| `tracks/track_0/data/sos_map/values` | `(1, 800, 800)` | float32 | m/s | Ground-truth SOS slice (sim-grid in-plane cross-section at the ring) |

| `custom/z_off`, `custom/phantom_z_idx`, `custom/element_focus` | scalar | int / float | – / m | Ring z-offset, phantom z-slice index, element focus (0.075 m) |

Attenuation is in the zea base unit **dB/m/Hz**; the map `coordinates` carry the
physical grid (XZ plane, y = 0).

## Subject Metadata

Not applicable — all data are synthetic. Aggregate phantom statistics:

- **Anatomical region:** breast cross-sections. The 3D-sim set samples several
  z-planes per phantom (one 2D cross-section each).
- **Tissue classes represented:** fat, glandular, skin/connective, with
  continuous SOS/attenuation/density assignments.
- **No PHI.**

## Data Validation

A single reference reconstruction, [`reconstruct.py`](reconstruct.py), serves
**both** sub-datasets. It builds a `zea.Pipeline` whose beamforming stage is
zea's dedicated `zea.ops.USCTReflectivityDAS` — a round-trip time-of-flight
Delay-And-Sum that, for every pixel, coherently sums over all transmit/receive
pairs, rejects the direct through-transmission arrival, and apodizes to keep only
backscatter geometries. The pipeline is saved to [`pipeline.yaml`](pipeline.yaml).

The same code reconstructs the 2D-sim (256 transmits) and 3D-sim (64 transmits)
files because everything it needs is read **back from the zea file**: element
positions (`probe/probe_geometry`), the transmit selection (`scan/tx_apodizations`),
sampling rate (`scan/sampling_frequency`), time-zero (`scan/initial_times`), and
the imaging grid (from the ground-truth `coordinates`). The ring is stored in the
XZ imaging plane, so `zea.File.load_parameters` + `pipeline.prepare_parameters`
drive the reconstruction directly. A resulting image whose bright skin boundary
traces the ground-truth contour confirms the geometry, timing, and transmit
parameters were recorded correctly.

python reconstruct.py --input data/2d/phantom_xxx.hdf5
python reconstruct.py --input data/3d/phantom_xxx.hdf5
```

## Known Issues

- **2D-sim vs 3D-sim differ in geometry and sampling** — 60 mm vs 110.9 mm ring;
  256 vs 64 transmits; 867 @ 6.67 MHz (130 µs) vs 2161 @ 12 MHz (~180 µs); 230²
  (0.30 mm) vs 800² (0.29 mm) GT maps. Users combining both must resample to a
  common grid.
- **2D-sim point elements vs 3D-sim focused elements:** the 2D-sim set idealizes
  elements as points (no element directivity), while the 3D-sim set models finite
  focused elements (0.558 mm × 19 mm, 75 mm elevation focus) and out-of-plane
  propagation.
- **Attenuation units:** stored in the zea base unit `dB/m/Hz` (converted from the
  simulation's `dB/cm/MHz`; `1 dB/cm/MHz = 1e-4 dB/m/Hz`). The k-Wave `alpha_power`
  is the `attenuation_map/gamma` field (α(f)=α₀·fᵞ, γ=1.01).
- **Time-zero convention:** in both sets `t = 0` is the emission centroid (carried
  in `scan/initial_times`), not the first recorded sample — important for
  time-of-flight methods.

## Ethical Considerations

Fully synthetic dataset. No human or animal subjects; no consent, IRB, or
de-identification requirements apply. The VICTRE breast phantoms are publicly
released by the U.S. FDA/NCI. No usage caveats beyond the CC BY 4.0 attribution
requirement.
