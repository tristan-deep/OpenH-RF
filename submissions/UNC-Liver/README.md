# fullwave-abdominal-wall: Fullwave abdominal wall simulation dataset

## Dataset Description

Full-wave nonlinear acoustic simulations of transabdominal liver imaging through
anatomically realistic numerical phantoms of the human abdominal wall. Each acquisition
pairs **full synthetic aperture (multistatic) RF channel data** with the **exact
ground-truth material maps that generated it**: speed of sound, density, absorption and
the coefficient of nonlinearity, plus a per-pixel tissue segmentation.

The phantoms were segmented from Visible Human Project cryosection photography at
0.33 mm isotropic resolution and interpolated to 0.0825 mm. Wave propagation was
simulated with Fullwave 2, which models reverberation, aberration and nonlinear
propagation. The transducer modelled is a curvilinear C5-2v (Verasonics).

This is **simulated** data. Its distinguishing property is that the ground truth is
exact rather than estimated: the sound-speed and attenuation maps are the simulation
inputs, not a reconstruction, which makes it directly usable for training and
quantitative evaluation of sound-speed estimation and aberration-correction methods.

## Intended Usage

- **Speed-of-sound estimation:** exact per-pixel ground-truth sound speed, randomised
  per tissue per simulation so the mapping is not memorisable from anatomy alone.
- **Aberration correction:** measured RMS arrival-time aberration is
  138.9 ± 78.4 ns across the dataset.
- **Reverberation / clutter suppression:** the abdominal wall produces realistic
  diffuse reverberation (decay in the expected −12 to −10 dB/cm range).
- **Advanced beamforming:** the multistatic full synthetic aperture matrix supports
  retrospective synthesis of any transmit sequence (focused, plane wave, diverging).
- **Tissue segmentation** from channel data.

## Dataset Characterization

- **Data Collection Method:** synthetic (Fullwave 2 numerical simulation)
- **Labeling Method:** synthetic ground truth (simulation inputs)
- **Acquisition system:** simulated Verasonics **C5-2v curvilinear array**: 128
  elements, 49.57 mm radius of curvature, 0.508 mm arc pitch, 3.7 MHz transmit centre
  frequency, 70% fractional bandwidth, 14.436 MHz sampling. Transmit pulse is a
  two-cycle Gaussian-enveloped sine at 0.1 MPa. No lens or matching layer is modelled.

## Dataset Format

All files are in the *zea* file format (written with zea 0.1.2), one HDF5 file per
acquisition, single track.

**Pre-processing applied before packaging:** none to the channel data. It is the
native simulator output at full rate. The simulation ran at 101.1 MHz and was
decimated by 7 to the stored 14.436 MHz *by the simulator*, before this packaging.

Coordinate frame: `x` is lateral, `y ≡ 0` (the simulations are 2-D), `z` is depth.
The **array apex is at z = 0** and the centre of curvature at `z = −49.57 mm`, matching
zea's `polar_pixel_grid` convention. `probe_geometry`, `transmit_origins` and every map
`coordinates` array share this frame, so the channel data and the maps are exactly
registered.

Transmit sequence: **full synthetic aperture**: each element fires alone and all 128
elements receive. Hence `t0_delays` is all-zero, `tx_apodizations` is the identity, and
`focus_distances` is zero. `initial_times` is **negative** (−79.17 ns): the simulator's
transmit start time offset means sample 0 corresponds to a two-way time of flight of
−t0.

Transmit and receive element positions differ slightly. `probe_geometry` holds the
**receive** element positions and `scan/transmit_origins` the **transmit** element
positions; the Fullwave simulation discretizes the transmit and receive apertures onto
separate arcs of its grid that sit about 0.16 mm (≈ 0.4 wavelengths) apart. This is a
property of the source simulation, not an error. When beamforming, use
`transmit_origins` for the transmit leg and `probe_geometry` for the receive leg, as the
shipped reference reconstruction does.

## Dataset Quantification

- **1906 acquisitions**, 1 frame each, 128 transmits × 128 receives per acquisition.
- **Total size on disk: ~213 GB** (~119 MB per file, Blosc/zstd level 7 + bitshuffle).
- Drawn from **14 distinct phantom volumes** derived from a single Visible Human
  subject: `vishuman_abdominal_cropped` (308), `vishuman_abdwall_153_h` (187),
  `vishuman_abdwall_cropped_7-153s` (148), `vishuman_abdwall_cropped_5left153s` (134),
  `vishuman_abdwall_cropped_7left153s` (133), `vishuman_abdwall_set_04` (123),
  `vishuman_abdwall_cropped_6left153s` (119), `vishuman_abdwall_set_13` (114),
  `vishuman_abdwall_set_05` (113), `vishuman_abdwall_set_12` (109),
  `vishuman_abdwall_set_07` (109), `vishuman_abdwall_set_10` (108),
  `vishuman_abdwall_set_06` (104), `vishuman_abdwall_set_11` (97).

### Splits

`dataset_split.csv` ships alongside the HDF5 files. Splits are **grouped by phantom
volume** so that no volume appears in both train and validation. This avoids anatomical
leakage, which matters because many acquisitions are different 2-D slices of the same
volume.

| Split | Train | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| `half_half_1` | 1143 | 763 |
| `half_half_2` | 1071 | 835 |
| `fold1` | 1251 | 558 |
| `fold2` | 1257 | 540 |
| `fold3` | 1314 | 488 |
| `fold4` | 1328 | 465 |

Note the `fold*` splits are **not** complementary: between 97 and 153 acquisitions are
in neither the train nor the validation set of a given fold.

## Subject Metadata

Aggregate only; no PHI. All phantoms derive from **one** Visible Human Project cadaveric
subject (female), so the dataset represents a single anatomy sampled at many slice
positions and orientations, with randomised abdominal wall thickness (5–71 mm, mean
41.0 mm, SD 8.9 mm) and randomised per-tissue acoustic properties.

Tissue composition varies by volume type; across the phantom volumes reported in the
source publication, subcutaneous fat and muscle predominate (fat 56.5 ± 8.3%, muscle
22.2 ± 7.7%, connective 20.7 ± 4.2%, blood 0.6 ± 0.5% for wall-dominated volumes).

## Data Validation

`reconstruct.py` builds a `zea.Pipeline`
(`Cast → Demodulate → Beamform(delay_and_sum) → EnvelopeDetect → Normalize → LogCompress`),
reconstructs from the raw channel data on the polar grid, scan-converts to a physical
sector and writes a PNG. The pipeline plus its grid parameters are saved in
`pipeline.yaml`.

Requires `zea==0.1.2` and any Keras backend (`reconstruct.py` falls back to torch if
`KERAS_BACKEND` is unset, but respects whatever you have configured).

```bash
python reconstruct.py <file>.hdf5 --out bmode.png --save-yaml pipeline.yaml
```

Reference outputs: `bmode_reference.png`.

**Geometry validation.** The zea reconstruction was checked against the reference
delay-and-sum image shipped with the source dataset: radial registration lag **0
samples**, lateral lag **0 beams**, structural correlation 0.92–0.95 (8×8 and 16×16
smoothed). Residual speckle-level decorrelation is expected: the reference used a
Hilbert analytic signal with bicubic interpolation, while the zea pipeline demodulates
to baseband with its own interpolation and apodization.

## Known Issues

- **`fs / f0` = 14.436 / 3.7 = 3.90**, marginally below the ×4 heuristic often applied
  to RF. This is the simulator's native rate (101.1 MHz decimated by 7) and still
  satisfies Nyquist for the −6 dB bandwidth of a 70%-fractional-bandwidth 3.7 MHz pulse
  (band edge ≈ 5.0 MHz, Nyquist 7.2 MHz). No aliasing is present.
- **`segmentation` is derived, not stored.** The simulator's own integer segmentation is
  a *per-volume region index* whose index-to-tissue mapping differs between phantom
  volumes, so those indices are not comparable across acquisitions. It is preserved
  verbatim as `phantom_region_map` for provenance. The shipped `segmentation` is
  recovered per pixel from the exact (density, β, absorption) fingerprint of each tissue
  in the simulator's material table. These three properties are constants, whereas
  sound speed is randomly drawn per tissue per simulation and is therefore excluded from
  the classification. Pixels on tissue boundaries are softened by the simulator's
  Gaussian blur (σ = 1 pixel) and are assigned to the nearest pure tissue.
- **2-D simulations.** Elevational focusing and out-of-plane scattering are not
  modelled. The source publication argues this is acceptable for subcostal
  transabdominal scanning, where ribs do not obstruct the field.
- **Single subject.** All anatomy derives from one Visible Human cadaver, so anatomical
  variability is limited to slice position, orientation, wall-thickness scaling and
  randomised acoustic properties. Simulations overlap spatially due to random sampling
  within volumes; the `volume` column allows filtering for overlap.
- **Postmortem blood redistribution** in the supine source cadaver produces additional
  contrast of connective tissue in the posterior portions of the images and limits
  connective tissue visibility anteriorly.

## Ethical Considerations

The data is entirely synthetic. It contains no patient data, no PHI and no identifiable
information. The underlying anatomy derives from the **Visible Human Project**, a
publicly released cadaveric imaging dataset collected with documented donor consent by
the U.S. National Library of Medicine; no living subjects are involved and no IRB
approval is applicable to the simulation work. The VHP source imagery is provided under
open NLM Terms and Conditions and is acknowledged as required (see License / Terms of
Use). No patient consent or de-identification concerns arise because no patient data is
present at any stage.
